Bank Loan Case Study


In this project, we aim to analyze a loan dataset at a finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. Company facing a challenge like some customers who don't have a sufficient credit history take advantage of this and default on their loans. We are going to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze patterns in the data and ensure that capable applicants are not rejected.
